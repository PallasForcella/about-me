    Introduction
  </h1>
  <p>
    I'm a very curious person, always excited to learn new things. Because of this I tend to do all the things all the time which osolates between fun and stressful. I have traveled a lot in my life, and it is an importaint part of who I am, though I now have a 6 month old so I will not be traveling for a while. A small sacrifice for such an amazing creature. Being very sensitve I love all living things and am very empathic, however I am currently in a war with the weeds in my yard so have become desensitized to dandilion carniage.

  <p>
    Being a good mother to my little girl Wren is the most importaint thing to me.

    More About Me
  </h1>
  <h2>
    "Free" Time
  </h2>
  <p>
    In my spare time I run a small etsy business called <a href="https://www.etsy.com/shop/LevelOneHuman?ref=hdr_shop_menu">Level One Human</a> and a small charitable orginization that makes warm items for the homeless called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/IdleHandsCrafting">Idle Hands Crafting</a>. I would also like to get back to painting.
  </p>
  <h2>
    Dream Job
  </h2>
  <p>I don't have a specific dream job, only requirments for such. It would give me independence and flexability while allowing me to leverage my creativity. I suppose I would like to just be an artist, however I recognize the struggle that comes along with that, so I am content to have a job that satisfies the above needs.
